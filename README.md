# Project-2 P2P Vinyl & CD Resale
By Group: Will Work For Stock Grants
​
​
## Description
=======
​
We wanted to utilize our web development powers to create a usable marketplace for fans of music to buy and sell their physical media. In the age of the internet, music collection has made it easier to locate the music we all love. Access to every private collection has replaced the local record store. By creating a website for music collectors we have leveraged the power of peer 2 peer connection to distribute old and new albums for music lovers anywhere.
​
We've learned how to make the best use of git as a team to create a web application that utilizes backend, middleware, and front end to slowly build functionality piece by piece and page by page. We've learned how to troubleshoot API routes and how to utilize sequelize to setup a backend database of the kind of user-built product content you would find in such an online marketplace.

AS A user who owns albums on CD or vinyl,
I WANT a P2P online store dedicated to music,
SO THAT I can sell albums for a profit to other fans.

<!-- A website where users can list physical music, such as CDs or Vinyl Records, for sale to other users. Users can browse the site by the user (to see all listings from a user), by category (to see all CD listings), etc., select items they're interested in to place into a shopping cart and purchase the items in their shopping cart.

If we can add a search bar to bring up listings that match the search terms (so someone can search Parliament or Funkadelic and get a list of CDs or Vinyl available for purchase from those artists) that would be awesome

We will need to add some kind of selection or add-to-cart button on every listing when generating it through the handlebar -->
