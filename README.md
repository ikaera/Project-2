# Project-2 P2P Vinyl & CD Resale
By Group: Will Work For Stock Grants
​
​
## Description
=======
​
We wanted to utilize our web development powers to create a usable marketplace for fans of music to buy and sell their physical media. In the age of the internet, music collection has made it easier to locate the music we all love. Access to every private collection has replaced the local record store. By creating a website for music collectors we have leveraged the power of peer 2 peer connection to distribute old and new albums for music lovers anywhere.
​
We've learned how to make the best use of git as a team to create a web application that utilizes backend, middleware, and front end to slowly build functionality piece by piece and page by page. We've learned how to troubleshoot API routes and how to utilize sequelize to setup a backend database of the kind of user-built product content you would find in such an online marketplace.

## Installation
​
Simply go to the Heroku webpage provided below.
You will need to sign up with a new account in order to access the website beyond the homepage.
​
## Usage
​
This is a website where users can list physical music, such as CDs, cassettes, or Vinyl Records for sale to other users. Users can browse the site by the user (to see all listings from a user), by category (to see all CD listings), etc., select items they're interested in to place into a shopping cart and purchase the items in their shopping cart.
​
You can search for any category in the search bar, provide your own listings on your user page, save items for later and even bring them to the cart page to purchase.
​
Listings can be deleted, items in the favorites page can be removed or added to the shopping cart directly and the shopping cart shows a subtotal sum of all item prices within, which updates if any items are removed from the shopping cart.
